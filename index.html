            <h1>The Sales and Install Process</h1>

                    <h2>Appointment Readiness</h2>
                    <h3>Review Customer Info</h3>
                    <p>Review the customer’s information (name, job notes, etc.). Check for any special circumstances that have been requested from NIS. Reviewing the customer's order and potential add-ons before your visit is crucial. It makes upselling difficult when you don’t have the product with you. Also, this ensures that you have the right tools for the installation, which is a top priority!</p>
                    <h3>Discover Interests</h3>
                    <p>Look for visual cues such as cars, boats, toys, and alarm signs. Understand the neighborhood type, the presence of schools, and any other relevant information. This helps you tailor your approach and connect with the customer on a personal level.</p>
                    <h3>Preempt Potential Issues</h3>
                    <p>Identify and address potential issues before they become problems. This includes ensuring your tools are ready, understanding any safety protocols, and being aware of any competitive products the customer may already have.</p>
